      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research centers on advancing both the theoretical and practical aspects of GNSS and LEO-based systems. I am particularly interested in:
        1. Satellite Navigation: Developing robust solutions for PPP, RTK, and PPP-RTK to achieve more accurate positioning.
        2. LEO Satellite Orbit Determination: Enhancing techniques for high-precision orbit computation, which is crucial for scientific and commercial missions.
        3. Time and Frequency Transfer: Improving GNSS-based time and frequency transfer methods, focusing on undifferenced and uncombined strategies with integer ambiguity resolution.
        4. GNSS Remote Sensing: Applying GNSS signals for atmospheric remote sensing, especially ionospheric and tropospheric delay determination.
        5. AI Applications in Geoscience: Leveraging foundational AI models to forecast tropospheric delay, supporting resilience in navigation and advancements in microwave remote sensing.
        
        Through collaboration and continuous learning, I strive to contribute to the evolution of GNSS technology and its applications, aiming to make a lasting impact across both earth and space sciences.
